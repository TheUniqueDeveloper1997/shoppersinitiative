Welcome to shoppers initiative, what first began as a project that i just started  to see how sanity and react work, it came into fruition when i started to play around  with the stripe payment system. This project has a beatiful modern design that have made waves and impacts among similar projects in terms of front end design. With sanity it has  the ability to add and delete products on the go with a content management system, we added  card animations as well as the beauty of the stripe payment system that allows us to be able to cover real payments. This is the beginning of me learning how to apply proper  folder structure as well as hooks and references, I had used React context API for state  management, I also had used filed based routing and data fetching as well with next.js which had allowed server-side rendering and static generation for pure optimization. With  next.js as a backend endpoint server i was able to grab data from my backend to display on our front-end components. With stripe it allowed us to make payments and allow shipping rates for the entirety of the checkout process.

• Designed and implemented with a sanity backend to manage products.      
• Backend was developed using next.js which allowed for server-side rendering and static generation for pure optimization.        
• Designed and implemented payment system with stripe.
